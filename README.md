# CPP Expedition
cpp expedition exploring usefull libs and framworks made by awsome ppl.
# Contribution 
It's easy just make a foler name should be same as **framework** or **libs** name XD.

Each folder has **main.cpp** it use framework functions (only one function `main()`). 

For extra _declaration_/_definition_ make **helper.h** and **helper.cpp**.

Just make sure you know these:
- Basics
- Files
- OOP
- Exception Handling
- STL
- Template
